 what im aiming for is a pre-trip, trailer inventory empty/full, live chat for the employees logged in, a page with 6 boxes that ,to represent docking bays i want there to be two sides to this one side for the loaders to be able to toggle when trailers are done as well as a spot for them to put trailers in some sort of notes area for communication of trailers to jockeys, when they toggle it on their side it turns the bay they toggle red and green for the jockeys, jockeys should have a place to label each bay the company name of the trailer and the trailer number  as well as a toggle that does the same as  loads toggle, turns  red when toggled by jockey turns green to the loaders, the dock pages should log driver the loader for each trailer and times, logging in 12 hour increment 7 to 7  labeled day shift and night shift with dates and be downloadable or uploadable to the cloud. the pre-trip also logged by trailer number driver and issues, and there should be a login page where employees can log in when they are working and save their work to their profile/ account for documentation
